George Herbert Walker Bush was born on June 12, 1924, in Milton, Massachusetts, to Dorothy Walker Bush and Prescott Bush, a banker who went on to represent Connecticut in the U.S. Senate from 1952 to 1963. The younger Bush was raised in Greenwich, Connecticut, and graduated from Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, in 1942.

After graduation, Bush joined the U.S. Naval Reserve to fight in World War II, which America had entered in December 1941. When he received his wings shortly before his 19th birthday, Bush was the nation’s youngest commissioned pilot at the time. He flew 58 combat missions during the war, and received the Distinguished Flying Cross for bravery after his torpedo plane was shot down by the Japanese in the vicinity of the Bonin Islands in the Pacific on September 2, 1944. During that incident, Bush’s plane was hit and set on fire but he continued toward his target, a radio station, and successfully bombed it before parachuting out of his plane. He later was rescued from the water by an American submarine.

In 2000, Bush’s son George, a two-term Texas governor, was elected president and served two terms. The Bushes were the second father and son to ascend to the presidency. (The first were John Adams, the second U.S. president, and John Quincy Adams, the sixth U.S. president). Another Bush son, Jeb, was a two-term governor of Florida from 1999 to 2007. George H.W. Bush died November 30, 2018 at the age of 94. He was the longest-lived president in U.S. history.
