John Edgar Hoover was born on January 1, 1895, in Washington, D.C.
After graduating high school, he worked at the Library of Congress while taking night school classes at George Washington University Law School, eventually earning his LLB (bachelor of laws) and LLM (master of laws) degrees there.
In 1917, the year the United States entered World War I, Hoover passed the bar and obtained a draft-exempt position as a clerk with the Department of Justice.
Appointed as a special assistant to Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer in 1919, Hoover began assembling information about tens of thousands of political “radicals,” using military and government intelligence, police investigations, private detectives, informants and many other tools – some of dubious legality – that he would put to effective use throughout his long career.
Early on the morning of May 2, 1972, Hoover died in his sleep at the age of 77.
In the days after his death, President Nixon reportedly directed staff at the Justice Department to obtain the voluminous “secret” personal files Hoover kept in his office.
But by the time they got there, Hoover’s personal secretary had destroyed all the files, according to her boss’ instructions.
After Hoover died – and accusations mounted that his FBI had used illegal surveillance to spy on antiwar and political groups over the decades – the Justice Department would take steps to rein in the bureau.
Crucially, they limited its directorship to a 10-year term, ensuring that no director after Hoover could exert so much power for so long.
