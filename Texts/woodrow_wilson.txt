Thomas Woodrow Wilson was born on December 28, 1856, in Staunton, Virginia. (Because his mother said he arrived around midnight, some sources list Wilson’s birthday as December 29.)
His father, Joseph Ruggles Wilson (1822-1903), was a Presbyterian minister, and his mother, Janet Woodrow Wilson (1826-1888), was a minister’s daughter and originally from England.
Tommy Wilson, as he was called growing up, spent his childhood and teen years in Augusta, Georgia, and Columbia, South Carolina.
During the American Civil War (1861-1865), Wilson’s father served as a chaplain in the Confederate army and used his church as a hospital for injured Confederate troops.
Wilson graduated from Princeton University (then called the College of New Jersey) in 1879 and went on to attend law school at the University of Virginia.
After briefly practicing law in Atlanta, Georgia, he received a Ph.D. in political science from Johns Hopkins University in 1886. (Wilson remains the only U.S. president to earn a doctorate degree.)
He taught at Bryn Mawr College and Wesleyan College before being hired by Princeton in 1890 as a professor of jurisprudence and politics.
From 1902 to 1910, Wilson was president of Princeton, where he developed a national reputation for his educational reform policies.
In 1885, Wilson married Ellen Axson (1860-1914), a minister’s daughter and Georgia native.
The couple had three daughters before Ellen died of kidney disease in 1914, during her husband’s first presidential term.
The following year, Wilson married Edith Bolling Galt (1872-1961), a widow whose husband had owned a Washington, D.C., jewelry business.
After leaving office in March 1921, Woodrow Wilson resided in Washington, D.C.
He and a partner established a law firm, but poor health prevented the president from ever doing any serious work.
Wilson died at his home on February 3, 1924, at age 67.
He was buried in the Washington National Cathedral, the only president to be interred in the nation’s capital.
