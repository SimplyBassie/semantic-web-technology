Edward Moore Kennedy was born in Boston on February 22, 1932, the youngest of nine children of Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. (1888-1969), a wealthy financier who served as the first chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and later as ambassador to Great Britain, and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy (1890-1995), the daughter of a Boston politician.
As a child, Kennedy moved between his family’s homes in Massachusetts, New York, Palm Beach and London, and attended 10 schools before graduating from Milton Academy in Massachusetts in 1950.
He went on to attend Harvard University, the alma mater of his father and three older brothers.
During his freshman year, he was expelled after a classmate took a Spanish exam in his place.
Kennedy then enlisted in the U.S. Army, serving from 1951 to 1953, mostly in Europe.
Afterward, he re-enrolled in Harvard, where he became a more serious student and played on the football team.
After graduating in 1956, he attended the University of Virginia School of Law.
While still a law student, he managed his brother John’s successful 1958 reelection campaign to the U.S. Senate, where he represented Massachusetts.
The following year, Kennedy earned his law degree and was admitted to the Massachusetts bar.
