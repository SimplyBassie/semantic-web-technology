He was the first of five children of Sam Ealy Johnson Jr. , a farmer, businessman and state legislator, and his wife, Rebekah Baines Johnson. The young Johnson graduated from Southwest State Teachers College (now Texas State University) in San Marcos, Texas, in 1930. To help pay for his education, he taught at a school for disadvantaged Mexican-American students in south Texas. Following the inauguration of Republican President Nixon, Johnson retired to his Texas ranch, where he spent the next few years establishing his presidential library (which opened in 1971 on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin) and writing his memoirs. <font color='red'>Johnson</font> <font color='green'>died of</font> <font color='blue'>a heart attack</font> at age 64 on January 22, 1973, at his ranch."</h6></div><body><html>
